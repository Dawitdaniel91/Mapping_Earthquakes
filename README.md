# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of Project
The Purpose of this project is to visualize ehe differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.From the project, expected to deliver the folowing output:-
Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

## Tech-Overview
For the project , we are isomg  the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. 

## Tasks 
In the project using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

## Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
By Using  knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data,add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

The codes uses for adding the second layer is 

## Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

By Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data,  add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

By Using knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.
