# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world.From the project, expected to deliver the folowing output:-

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

## Tech-Overview
For the project , we are using  the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. 

## Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
By Using  knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data,add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

The codes uses for adding the second layer is 

## Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

By Using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data,  add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

## Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

By Using knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.
